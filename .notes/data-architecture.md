Updated Concept Overview
Dual-Layer Data Storage
Local Storage (via unstorage/localStorage):
Your current setup remains unchanged for immediate state updates, offline capability, and the UI’s source of truth during user interactions.
Remote Storage (BasicDB):
Used for cross-client synchronization. Every project or component record will include a versioning timestamp (e.g., a lastModified field) to support a "last modified wins" approach.
Synchronization Strategy
Initialization:
On app startup, load the state from local storage and then fetch the remote data from BasicDB (using Basic's getToken for authenticated access). Compare timestamps: if the remote version is newer, update (replace) the local copy.
Local Updates:
When data is changed (for example, adding an emoji or renaming a project), the change is written to local storage immediately. Then, using a debounced update mechanism, the updated data is pushed to BasicDB remotely.
Remote Updates:
Remote updates (delivered by BasicDB via a WebSocket, though not as immediate if it causes issues) are handled by a synchronization service. If a remote update arrives with a newer timestamp, it will overwrite the local copy. Since you favor "last modified wins," the remote version always replaces local when it's more recent.
Conflict Resolution
Last Modified Wins:
Every record includes a lastModified timestamp. Conflicts are resolved by comparing these timestamps; the newer update wins.
Editing Considerations:
If a user is actively editing a component, you can temporarily suspend processing remote updates to avoid UI disruptions, though ultimately the remote version (if newer) will overwrite the local state when safe.
Delayed (Debounced) Syncing
Given that you don't need instant real-time sync (to avoid out-of-sync issues), updates to BasicDB can be delayed by a brief period (for example, 500–1000 ms) to allow batching of changes. This delay minimizes excessive remote writes while maintaining a near–real-time feeling.
Token Refresh and Remote Requests
Use Basic's getToken to obtain an access token (refreshing every hour) before making remote requests. All remote API calls will include this token for authentication.
Schema Enhancements
Versioning/Timestamp:
Update your BasicDB schema (in basic.config.ts) to include a lastModified (or optionally a version) field on each record (e.g., for projects and component data) to support version comparison.
Example:
In your project record:
{
id
,
 
name
,
 
parentId
,
 
type
,
 
lastModified
,
 
components
}
{id, name, parentId, type, lastModified, components}
For components (like Emojis), ensure each component's data object also has a lastModified timestamp.

2. Initialization Process
Step 1:
At startup, load the local data from unstorage.
Existing code in stores.ts remains unchanged for local reading.
Step 2:
Call the sync service. It uses Basic’s getToken to authenticate and then requests the latest state from BasicDB.
Step 3:
Compare the lastModified timestamp from BasicDB with that of the local storage.
If the remote version is newer, overwrite the local data with the remote state.
If the local version is newer, do nothing (or schedule a remote update).
3. Handling Local Updates
Immediate Local Write:
When a local change occurs (e.g., via updateComponentData, addProject, or editing in the UI), update the local store immediately.
Debounced Remote Sync:
Each update triggers an event observed by the Sync Service. Use a debounce function (e.g., 500–1000 ms) before pushing the update to BasicDB.
Remote Write:
When the debounced timer fires, prepare the updated record with the current lastModified timestamp and send it to BasicDB along with the token from getToken.
4. Handling Remote Updates
Listening for Remote Pushes:
If BasicDB’s @react system pushes updates over websockets (WSS), have the Sync Service listen for these updates.
Version Comparison & Overwriting:
When a remote update is received:
Extract the record’s lastModified timestamp.
Compare it with the local record.
If the remote timestamp is newer, update the local store accordingly.
If the user is editing (optional): either delay the update or provide a non-intrusive notification.
Offline Mode:
If the remote update fails (e.g., network issues, token problems), continue operating in offline mode. The Sync Service should retry remote sync without interrupting local activity.
5. Schema Recommendations
Projects Schema (in basic.config.ts):
Components (for example, Emojis):
Each component’s data payload should include a lastModified field. This allows the Sync Service to easily decide when to overwrite the local version.
6. Token Management
Using Basic’s getToken:
Always acquire a fresh token (which refreshes every hour) before making remote updates. The Sync Service should cache and refresh the token as needed.
7. Error Handling & Retry
Remote Update Failures:
If remote syncing fails, the local store remains intact. The Sync Service should log the error and schedule a retry.
User Feedback:
Optionally notify the user (e.g., via a subtle indicator) that the sync is temporarily in offline mode.
8. Integration with Existing Files
stores.ts:
Continue to use local data operations as is. Emit events or call Sync Service functions on write operations.
ProjectWorkspace.tsx, Emojis.tsx, ProjectSidebar.tsx:
No changes needed in how UI components access the local store. All remote sync logic is encapsulated in the Sync Service.
New Module (syncService.ts):
Create a dedicated module that:
Listens to local store changes.
Initiates remote fetches on initialization.
Manages delayed remote updates.
Listens for websocket events from BasicDB, compares timestamps, and updates the local store as needed.
Summary
Your new architecture introduces a Sync Service Module between your local store and BasicDB. The Sync Service will:
Initialize the app by comparing local and remote data using a lastModified timestamp.
Push local updates to BasicDB in a delayed (debounced) manner.
Listen for remote updates (over websockets) and update the local store if the remote lastModified timestamp is newer.
Always allow offline mode and retries when remote syncing fails.
Use Basic’s getToken for authentication before remote operations.
Be schema-aware: add a lastModified (and optionally a version) field to your data for conflict resolution.
This approach lets you keep your local data-handling intact while gaining the benefits of cross-client synchronization via BasicDB. Remote data will always win if it’s more recent, and debounced syncing will prevent out-of-sync issues during heavy editing.
